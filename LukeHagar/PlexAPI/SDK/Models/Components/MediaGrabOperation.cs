        /// Items in a library are referred to as &quot;metadata items.&quot; These metadata items are distinct from &quot;media items&quot; which represent actual instances of media that can be consumed. Consider a TV library that has a single video file in it for a particular episode of a show. The library has a single media item, but it has three metadata items: one for the show, one for the season, and one for the episode. Consider a movie library that has two video files in it: the same movie, but two different resolutions. The library has a single metadata item for the movie, but that metadata item has two media items, one for each resolution. Additionally a &quot;media item&quot; will have one or more &quot;media parts&quot; where the the parts are intended to be watched together, such as a CD1 and CD2 parts of the same movie.<br/>
        /// 
        /// <remarks>
        /// <br/>
        /// Note that when a metadata item has multiple media items, those media items should be isomorphic. That is, a 4K version and 1080p version of a movie are different versions of the same movie. They have the same duration, same summary, same rating, etc. and they can generally be considered interchangeable. A theatrical release vs. director&apos;s cut vs. unrated version on the other hand would be separate metadata items.<br/>
        /// <br/>
        /// Metadata items can often live in a hierarchy with relationships between them.  For example, the metadata item for an episodes is associated with a season metadata item which is associated with a show metadata item.  A similar hierarchy exists with track, album, and artist and photos and photo album.  The relationships may be expressed via relative terms and absolute terms.  For example, &quot;leaves&quot; refer to metadata items which has associated media (there is no media for a season nor show).  A show will have &quot;children&quot; in the form of seasons and a season will have &quot;children&quot; in the form of episodes and episodes have &quot;parent&quot; in the form of a season which has a &quot;parent&quot; in the form of a show.  Similarly, a show has &quot;grandchildren&quot; in the form of episodse and an episode has a &quot;grandparent&quot; in the form of a show.<br/>
